# Violence-Detection
 This repository contains the frontend part of our "Real time violence detection system using ip camera" project.

 The frontend is a web app, developed using React.js.

 You can simply create an account to log in, and add new cameras by entering its ip address, upload video to detect it has violence in it or not.

 The backend is not deployed on any server, thats why detection will not work on this public web app.
